# Calculus Workbook

## Overview
This **Calculus Workbook** is designed to help students learn and practice various calculus concepts through problems and exercises. The workbook includes chapters on limits, rates of change, and more, presented in a structured format with problems including their solutions.

## Structure
The workbook is formatted using LaTeX for high-quality typesetting. The main components of the workbook include:

- **Chapters**: Each chapter covers different topics in calculus, starting with the fundamentals and advancing to more complex concepts.
- **Problems**: Each chapter features a set of problems that encourage problem-solving and application of calculus concepts.
- **Solutions**: Although solutions are not explicitly provided in every problem, guidance on how to approach and solve them is included.

## Getting Started
To get started with the workbook, you will need a LaTeX editor or online platform (like Overleaf) to compile the `.tex` files into a PDF document. 

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshifulBhuiyan/calculus-workbook.git
   ```
2. Open the main `.tex` file in your LaTeX editor.
3. Compile the document to generate the PDF.

## Usage
You are encouraged to attempt each problem in the workbook without skipping any. Use the methodology and problem-solving strategies outlined in the introduction to guide your learning:

1. Attempt to solve problems mentally before writing.
2. If you're stuck, consult the provided solutions to help you understand the concepts better.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute solutions to the workbook or correcting existing ones, or improving the formatting. Contributions are welcome!

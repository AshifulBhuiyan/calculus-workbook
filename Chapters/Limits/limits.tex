\section{Rates of Change and the Slope of a Curve}
\subsubsection*{Key Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rate of Change}: The rate at which a quantity is changing with respect to another quantity.
    \item \textbf{Slope of a Curve}: The rate of change of a function at a specific point.
    \item \textbf{Tangent Line}: A line that touches a curve at a specific point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.
    \item \textbf{Derivative}: A function that gives the rate of change of another function at any point.
\end{itemize}

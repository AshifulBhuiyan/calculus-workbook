\subsection*{Goal}
Attempt all of the problems. Do not skip any problems.

\subsection*{Methodology}
Start from the beginning. Attempt to mentally solve the problem. If you know how to solve the problem, write down the solution. If you do not know how to solve the problem, look at the solution and use it to create your own. If you do not understand the solution, ask for help.

\subsection*{Patience and Trust}
This will take time. Be patient and trust in yourself. As long as you have read the problem, the solution will brew in your head over time. There are no deadlines to finishing this book. Do not cause yourself artificial stress by trying to rush through it, and just enjoy the math. Yeah.
